# Audit Checklist P5–P9 — Growth Loops (29 items)

Stanza format, flags, status vocabulary, and `new-app:` semantics are defined in `SKILL.md`.
Evidence keys (`EV.*`) are defined in `detection-playbook.md`. IDs are stable — never renumber.

## P5 — Experimentation

#### P5.1 Product Page Optimization running as a habit — core
- detect: MCP `EV.ppo`
- rule: ✅ a PPO experiment ran in the last 2 quarters or after the last asset change · 🟠 ran once, long ago · 🔴 never (up to 3 treatments on organic traffic, one variable at a time)
