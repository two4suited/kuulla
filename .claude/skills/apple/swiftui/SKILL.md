# SwiftUI Skills

Focused SwiftUI framework skills — each sub-skill covers one API area in depth.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Has **state/rendering bugs**: state resets, over-rendering, flashing lists, animation crossfades (data-flow)
- Is choosing **@State vs @Bindable vs @Environment** or migrating to Observation (data-flow)
- Builds **custom layouts or containers**, or fights **lazy-stack/scroll performance** (layout)
- Wants alarms or timers with **AlarmKit** (custom UI, Live Activities, snooze)
- Is creating **3D data visualizations** with Swift Charts (Chart3D, SurfacePlot)
- Needs **styled text or rich text editing** (Text, AttributedString, TextEditor)
- Is implementing or customizing **toolbars** (customizable toolbars, search integration)
- Wants to **embed web content** (WebView, WebPage, JavaScript interop)
