# crap-report.sh — CRAP metric report (from skills/testing/coverage-ratchet)
#
#   CRAP(f) = complexity(f)² × (1 − coverage(f))³ + complexity(f)
#
# Combines per-function cyclomatic complexity (SwiftLint JSON reporter) with
# per-function line coverage (xccov JSON) and prints the top 20 — the
# functions where a new test buys the most risk reduction.
#
# ADVISORY ONLY — never wire this as a gate. The join between SwiftLint's
# violation locations and xccov's function names is heuristic (file + line
# proximity); treat the output as a worklist, not a verdict.
#
# Usage: ./crap-report.sh <path/to/coverage.xcresult>
#   (reuse the result bundle coverage-gate.sh produces, or any -resultBundlePath)
