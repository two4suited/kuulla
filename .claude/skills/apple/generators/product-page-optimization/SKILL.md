# Product Page Optimization Generator

Create structured A/B test plans for App Store Product Page Optimization (PPO), including test hypotheses, variant designs, success metrics, and iteration strategy.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks to "optimize product page" or "A/B test App Store page"
- Mentions "product page optimization" or "PPO"
- Wants to improve "App Store conversion rate"
- Asks about "screenshot testing" or "icon testing"
- Mentions improving download rate or tap-through rate

## How PPO Works

- Test up to **3 treatments** against your original (control); a single test can include up to 3 app preview videos per treatment
- Testable elements: **app icon**, **screenshots**, **app previews**
- Traffic proportion: you choose **1–50%** of page traffic, split evenly across treatments (30% over 3 treatments = 10% each) — no treatment may exceed the original page's share
- Duration: run at least 1 week and extend in **7-day increments** to capture weekday/weekend cycles; hard cap **90 days**
- Statistical confidence: no confidence shown for the first 7 days; **90% confidence is the decision bar** — per Apple, "9 of 10 reruns would repeat the result"
- Localization: tests can target specific localizations only — confirm those locales have enough traffic to conclude within 90 days
- Icon treatments: can only use icons that already ship in the app binary's asset catalog as alternate icons — plan icon tests one release ahead
- Prerequisites: app must be Ready for Sale; role must be Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing

### Important Limitations
- Cannot test: app name, subtitle, description, keyword field, or price
- One test at a time per localization
- Only one test submission can be in App Review at a time
- Results apply to organic App Store traffic only
- Minimum traffic required for statistical significance

### Minimum Traffic Thresholds
**PPO requires sufficient impression volume to produce meaningful results.** If the app doesn't meet these thresholds, skip A/B testing and make direct qualitative improvements instead.

| Monthly Impressions | Can You PPO? | Recommendation |
|--------------------|--------------|----|
| **Under 1,000** | No | Don't bother — tests will never reach significance. Apply screenshot best practices directly. |
| **1,000-5,000** | Barely | Test ONE element at a time with only 1 variant (A/B, not A/B/C). Expect 4-8 week test cycles. |
| **5,000-20,000** | Yes | Standard testing. Run 2 variants per test, 2-4 week cycles. |
| **20,000+** | Aggressively | Test 3 variants, rapid iteration. Can test icon + screenshots sequentially. |

**If below threshold:** Focus on qualitative improvements (follow the Quick Win Checklist in the output) rather than running inconclusive A/B tests.

## Test Discipline (per Apple's Tech Talk)

- ✅ **Estimate before you start**: use App Store Connect's Estimate Your Test Duration tool — example: detecting a 5% improvement at 50% traffic needs ~174k impressions ≈ 2 weeks
- ✅ **Make treatments NOTABLY different** — subtle tweaks (small color shifts, reordered captions) typically end inconclusive
- ✅ **Have next-test assets ready before each release window** — icon candidates must ship in the binary, so an unprepared release stalls the pipeline a full cycle
- ✅ **A winning control is still learning** — you've validated the existing page and eliminated a hypothesis
- ❌ Don't stop a test early because a treatment "looks ahead" — confidence isn't even shown for the first 7 days
- ❌ Don't port A/B winners from other platforms or ad networks — App Store audiences convert differently

### Applying Winners

| Winning element | How it ships |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Screenshots / app previews | "Apply Treatment to Original Product Page" in App Store Connect — no new binary or review |
| App icon | Ship it as the default icon in the next app binary |

### Real Results (Apple-cited)

| App | Test | Result |
|-----|------|--------|
| Peak | Icon variants | +8% conversion at 98% confidence (44 days, 154K impressions per treatment) |
| Angry Birds 2 | Seasonal art vs. control | Control won (+1.5%, 100% confidence) — validated existing creative |
| Simply Piano | Screenshots-only vs. app preview | Screenshots-only won, +3.3% in 12 days |

## Configuration Questions

Ask user via AskUserQuestion:

1. **What do you want to test?**
   - App icon variants
   - Screenshot order/design
   - App preview video
   - Multiple elements (run sequentially)

2. **What's your current conversion rate concern?**
   - Low impression-to-page-view rate (need better icon/name)
   - Low page-view-to-download rate (need better screenshots/description)
   - Low overall conversion (need comprehensive optimization)
   - Don't know (need baseline measurement)

3. **Monthly impression volume?**
   - Under 1,000 (PPO may not reach significance — focus on qualitative improvements)
   - 1,000-10,000 (test one element at a time, longer test duration)
   - 10,000-100,000 (can test 2-3 variants, standard duration)
   - 100,000+ (can test aggressively, quick results)

## Generation Process

### Step 1: Audit Current Page

Review the existing product page:
- Current screenshot sequence and messaging
- Icon design and distinctiveness
- App preview presence and quality
- Promotional text and description

### Step 2: Generate Test Plan

Produce a structured test plan with:
- Hypothesis for each test
- Variant descriptions
- Expected impact
- Duration and traffic requirements

### Step 3: Design Variant Specs

For each variant, specify:
- What changes from control
- Design direction and mockup description
- Why this variant might outperform

## Quick Win Checklist

While waiting for PPO results, implement these proven improvements:
- [ ] First screenshot shows core value in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Screenshots use benefit-focused captions (not feature names)
- [ ] App preview starts with the "wow moment" in first 3 seconds
- [ ] Icon is distinct and recognizable at small sizes
- [ ] Promotional text includes a current hook or seasonal relevance
```

## Common Test Ideas

### Icon Tests
| Test | Control | Variant | Expected Impact |
|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Color | Current color | Contrasting color | Higher tap-through from search |
| Style | 3D/detailed | Flat/minimal | Modernized perception |
| Element | Full logo | Key symbol only | Better small-size recognition |
| Background | Solid | Gradient | Shelf standout |

**Plan one release ahead:** add candidate icons to the asset catalog as alternate app icons in THIS release so you can PPO-test them in the NEXT one. Shipping them costs nothing — users never see unused alternates.

### Screenshot Tests
| Test | Control | Variant | Expected Impact |
|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| First screenshot | Feature-focused | Benefit-focused | Higher engagement |
| Layout | Device frames | Full-bleed | More immersive |
| Text | Feature names | User outcomes | Stronger conversion |
| Order | Standard flow | Problem→Solution | Better storytelling |
| Social proof | None | Reviews/awards | Trust building |

### App Preview Tests
| Test | Control | Variant | Expected Impact |
|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Hook | Slow intro | Immediate action | Higher watch-through |
| Length | 30 seconds | 15 seconds | Less drop-off |
| Style | Screen recording | Lifestyle + UI | Emotional connection |

## Seasonal Optimization Calendar

| Season | Focus | Screenshot Refresh |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Jan | New Year energy, fresh starts | Resolution-themed captions |
| Mar-Apr | Spring cleaning, organization | Productivity-focused |
| Jun | WWDC, new OS features | "Updated for iOS [X]" |
| Aug-Sep | Back to school | Student/education focus |
| Nov-Dec | Holiday, gift-giving | Gift-worthy messaging |
